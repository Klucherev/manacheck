                Manacheck is a service for Magic:the Gathering, that helps you to create a perfect manabase for your deck.
                It emulates first rounds of the game 1000 times trying to obtain given combination of colors. It tries to figure best order
                of lands that will achieve goal as fast as possible. You can share result simply providing the link.
