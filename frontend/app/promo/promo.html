                Manacheck is a service for Magic:the Gathering, that helps you to create a perfect manabase for your deck.
                It emulates first rounds of the game 1000 times trying to obdain given combination of colors. It tries to figure best order
                of lands that will achieve goal as fast as possible. It doesn't cheat, all information it has based on given hand and given manabase,
                each turn he gets one card, like in a real game.
